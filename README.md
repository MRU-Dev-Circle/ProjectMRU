## About💬
- __Manav Rachna University__ hosting an online event __Project MRU (Hacktoberfest 2021)__ brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with Dev & Intel — is a month-long celebration of open-source software.
- Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered.

# ✨No contribution is too small✨

## What to do??💪
- To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). 
- PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. 
- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

Choose one or all 3, make a pull request for your work and wait for it to be merged!

### Getting started

* __Star this repository__ if you had fun!

### Choose from these tasks
(all three tasks need to be done)
#### 1. Add your name
Add your name to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file using the below convention:

```markdown
##### Name: [YOUR NAME](GitHub link)
- Place: City, State, Country
- Bio: Who are you?
- GitHub: [GitHub account name](GitHub link)
- LinkedIn: [LinkedIn name](LinkedIn link)
```

#### 2. Add a profile page
Add a `Your_Name.md` file to the `Profiles` directory. Use any combination of content and Markdown you'd like. Here is an example:

```markdown
# Your Name
### Location
Your City/Country
### Academics
Your School
### Interests
- Some Things You Like
### Projects
- [My Project](GitHub Link) Short Description
### Profile Link
[Your Name](GitHub Link)
```

### 3. Create a `Hello, World!` Script
Add a `hello_world_yourusername.xx` script to the `Scripts` directory in any language of your choice! Here is an example:

```Python
// LANGUAGE: Python
// AUTHOR: c0sm0s
// GITHUB: https://github.com/minnonymous

print('Hello, python!')
```

Name the file `hello_world_yourusername.xx`. e.g., `hello_world_minnonymous.py`

## Created sub-folders to upload/commit your code in any language or ideas.🗂️

## Standards💻
In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, quality is key), we have provided examples of pull requests that we consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).

- Pull requests that are automated (e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace/fix typos/optimize images).
- Pull requests that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request).
- Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.

Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.
Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.
