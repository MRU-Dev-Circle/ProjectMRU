## Aboutüí¨

- Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered.

Here are 3 quick and painless ways to contribute to this project:

* Add your name to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file (DONT REPLACE OTHER NAME AND INFO)
* Add a profile page to the `profiles` directory
* Create a simple "Hello, World" script in a language of your choice

Choose one or all 3, make a pull request for your work and wait for it to be merged!

### Getting started
* Fork this repository (Click the Fork button in the top right of this page, click your Profile Image)
* Clone your fork down to your local machine

```markdown
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ProjectMRU.git
```

* Create a branch

```markdown
git checkout -b branch-name
```

* Make your changes (choose from any task below)
* Commit and push

```markdown
git add .
git commit -m 'Commit message'
git push origin branch-name
```

* Create a new pull request from your forked repository (Click the `New Pull Request` button located at the top of your repo)
* Wait for your PR review and merge approval!
* __Star this repository__ if you had fun!

### Choose from these tasks
(all three tasks need to be done)
#### 1. Add your name
Add your name to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file using the below convention:

```markdown
##### Name: [YOUR NAME](GitHub link)
- Place: City, State, Country
- Bio: Who are you?
- GitHub: [GitHub account name](GitHub link)
- LinkedIn: [LinkedIn name](LinkedIn link)
```

#### 2. Add a profile page
Add a `Your_Name.md` file to the `Profiles` directory. Use any combination of content and Markdown you'd like. Here is an example:

```markdown
# Your Name
### Location
Your City/Country
### Academics
Your School
### Interests
- Some Things You Like
### Projects
- [My Project](GitHub Link) Short Description
### Profile Link
[Your Name](GitHub Link)
```

### 3. Create a `Hello, World!` Script
Add a `hello_world_yourusername.xx` script to the `Scripts` directory in any language of your choice! Here is an example:

```Python
// LANGUAGE: Python
// AUTHOR: c0sm0s
// GITHUB: https://github.com/minnonymous

print('Hello, python!')
```

Name the file `hello_world_yourusername.xx`. e.g., `hello_world_minnonymous.py`

## Created sub-folders to upload/commit your code in any language or ideas.üóÇÔ∏è

## Standardsüíª
In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, quality is key), we have provided examples of pull requests that we consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).

- Pull requests that are automated (e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace/fix typos/optimize images).
- Pull requests that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request).
- Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.

Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.
Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.
